# 2247 — Search previous gene symbols in variant articles

Status: OPEN.

Milestone: 0.9.4

## Outcome

Variant article search also queries a gene's previous official symbols and well-recorded aliases, labeled with where each came from, or states plainly that it searched only the current symbol.

## Evidence

Reproduced on 0.9.3: the ABCC8 R1437Q search never uses the older name SUR1. Europe PMC `SUR1 AND "R1437Q"` returns six PMIDs, including free PMC papers 10685980 and 9312191, against three for `ABCC8 AND "R1437Q"`.

## Keeps

Take alternative symbols only from a recorded source such as HGNC previous symbols, never a guess. Bound the number of extra queries within the deadline. Keep result order rules.

## Proof

A replay test shows the SUR1 query sent with its provenance and the extra papers returned, or the restriction stated in the output.

## Coordinator study brief

Restate the approved outcome, reproduce on current main before source edits, and report the exact command/output, proposed precise source/test paths and outside-in failing case. Reuse qualified unchanged current-main CLI when possible; all execution goes through the configured build job. Preserve exact raw source responses and invocation in the next numbered three-digit experiment on the executing host, with OWNER biomcp/2247. No live rerun if an existing deterministic replay already reproduces the same failure; any authored controls must be explicitly identified, not called captured source. Read source redistribution standards before publishing new captures. No product or test claim is granted yet. No source edits, WIP pushes, child agents, mail or status changes during this study. Stop after bounded reproduction and proposal; do not widen the ticket.
