- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Notes

- All items pass validation.
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for data source access patterns.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed; the PRD provided comprehensive detail
  on all 5 modules, their tools, priorities, and data sources.
- Scope boundaries clearly separate MVP (v1.0), v1.1 deferred items, and out-of-scope items.
