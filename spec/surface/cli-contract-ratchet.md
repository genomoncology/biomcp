# CLI Contract Ratchet

BioMCP keeps the public command surface in several places: clap help, `biomcp
list`, user documentation, architecture references, executable specs, and JSON
metadata. This local contract keeps the routine gate wired to the whole-surface
ratchet so drift cannot hide until review.

## Whole-Surface Contract Ratchet Runs in the Routine Gate

The whole-surface ratchet is a local contract: it checks the shipped command
surface and the source-controlled exception registry, not public upstream data.
The pytest contract below is the durable entrypoint for that policy.

```bash
set -o pipefail
cd ../.. && uv run --no-sync pytest tests/test_cli_surface_contract_ratchet.py -v 2>&1 | mustmatch like "test_quality_ratchet_runs_whole_surface_cli_contract
test_cli_surface_contract_exception_registry_names_initial_exceptions"
```
