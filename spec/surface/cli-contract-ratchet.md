# CLI Contract Ratchet

BioMCP keeps the public command surface in several places: clap help, `biomcp
list`, user documentation, architecture references, executable specs, and JSON
metadata. This local contract keeps the routine gate wired to the whole-surface
ratchet so drift cannot hide until review.

## Whole-Surface Contract Ratchet Runs in the Routine Gate

The whole-surface ratchet is a local contract: it checks the shipped command
surface and the source-controlled exception registry, not public upstream data.
The pytest contract below is the durable entrypoint for that policy.

```bash
set -o pipefail
cd ../.. && uv run --no-sync pytest tests/test_cli_surface_contract_ratchet.py -v 2>&1 | mustmatch like "test_quality_ratchet_runs_whole_surface_cli_contract
test_cli_surface_contract_exception_registry_names_initial_exceptions"
```

## Protein and Phenotype Search JSON Metadata Seam

Protein and phenotype search JSON should opt into the metadata envelope instead
of using the bare generic search helper. These fixture-backed tests exercise the
local JSON envelope and parse every emitted follow-up command, so the routine
ratchet does not depend on public upstream availability.

```bash
cd ../..
cargo test --locked protein_search_json_next_commands_parse --lib >/tmp/biomcp-protein-json-next-commands.log
cargo test --locked phenotype_search_json_next_commands_parse --lib >/tmp/biomcp-phenotype-json-next-commands.log
printf 'protein and phenotype JSON next-command fixture tests passed\n' | mustmatch like "fixture tests passed"
```
