# cBioPortal Enhancement Summary

## Overview
The cBioPortal integration in BioMCP has been enhanced to provide richer clinical and biological context for variant queries. Beyond basic occurrence counts, the integration now extracts and returns detailed mutation characteristics that are valuable for research and clinical interpretation.

## Enhanced Data Fields

### 1. **Cancer Type Distribution** ✅
- Maps mutations to specific cancer types (e.g., "Melanoma", "Lung Adenocarcinoma")
- Provides counts per cancer type to show mutation prevalence across different malignancies
- Fetches cancer type from study metadata for accurate classification

### 2. **Mutation Type Classification** ✅
- Categorizes mutations by functional impact (Missense_Mutation, Nonsense_Mutation, Frame_Shift_Del, etc.)
- Essential for understanding the biological consequences of variants

### 3. **Hotspot Identification** ✅
- Detects known cancer hotspot mutations using the `keyword` field
- Counts samples where the mutation is identified as a hotspot
- Helps prioritize clinically significant mutations

### 4. **Variant Allele Frequency (VAF)** ✅
- Calculates mean VAF across all samples using tumorAltCount and tumorRefCount
- Provides insight into clonality and tumor purity
- Helps distinguish driver vs passenger mutations

### 5. **Sample Type Distribution** ⚠️
- Currently defaults to "Unknown" due to API limitations
- Full implementation would require additional clinical data API calls
- Placeholder for future enhancement to distinguish Primary vs Metastatic samples

## Implementation Details

### Data Model
```python
class CBioPortalVariantData(BaseModel):
    """Enhanced cBioPortal variant annotation data."""
    total_cases: int | None
    studies: list[str]
    cancer_type_distribution: dict[str, int]  # NEW
    mutation_types: dict[str, int]           # NEW
    hotspot_count: int                       # NEW
    mean_vaf: float | None                   # NEW
    sample_types: dict[str, int]            # NEW (placeholder)
```

### Key Changes
1. **Study Metadata Fetching**: Added API calls to fetch study cancer type information
2. **Enhanced Mutation Processing**: Extracts multiple fields from each mutation record
3. **Conditional Formatting**: Only includes non-empty/non-zero fields in output
4. **Efficient API Usage**: Batches study metadata requests to minimize API calls

## Example Output
For a BRAF V600E query:
```json
{
  "total_cases": 51,
  "studies": ["coadread_mskcc", "glioma_mskcc_2019", "lung_msk_2017"],
  "cancer_types": {
    "Colorectal Adenocarcinoma": 4,
    "Diffuse Glioma": 24,
    "Lung Adenocarcinoma": 23
  },
  "mutation_types": {
    "Missense_Mutation": 51
  },
  "mean_vaf": 0.265
}
```

## Testing
- Unit tests updated with mock responses for new fields
- Integration tests verify real API responses include enhanced data
- All tests passing with proper type checking

## Future Enhancements
1. **Sample Type Classification**: Implement clinical data fetching for Primary/Metastatic distinction
2. **Co-occurring Mutations**: Query mutations in samples with the target variant
3. **Clinical Outcomes**: Correlate mutations with survival data where available
4. **Caching**: Add study metadata caching to reduce API calls

## Usage
The enhanced data is automatically included in all variant queries through BioMCP:
```bash
biomcp variant search --gene BRAF --significance pathogenic
```

The cBioPortal data will include the new fields when available, providing researchers with comprehensive mutation context for better clinical interpretation.
