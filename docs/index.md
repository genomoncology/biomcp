## What Can You Do with BioMCP?

### Search Research Literature

Find articles about genes, variants, diseases, and drugs with automatic cancer genomics data from cBioPortal

```bash
biomcp article search --gene BRAF --disease melanoma
```

### Discover Clinical Trials

Search active trials by condition, location, phase, and eligibility criteria including genetic biomarkers

```bash
biomcp trial search --condition "lung cancer" --status RECRUITING
```

### Analyze Genetic Variants

Query variant databases, predict effects, and understand clinical significance

```bash
biomcp variant search --gene TP53 --significance pathogenic
```

### AI-Powered Analysis

Use with Claude Desktop for conversational biomedical research with sequential thinking

```python
# Claude automatically uses BioMCP tools
"What BRAF mutations are found in melanoma?"
```

## 5-Minute Quick Start

### Choose Your Interface

=== "Claude Desktop (Recommended)"

    **Best for**: Conversational research, complex queries, AI-assisted analysis

    1. **Install Claude Desktop** from [claude.ai/desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop)

    2. **Configure BioMCP**:
       ```json
       {
         "mcpServers": {
           "biomcp": {
             "command": "uv",
             "args": [
        "run", "--with", "biomcp-python",
        "biomcp", "run"
      ]
           }
         }
       }
       ```

    3. **Start researching**: Ask Claude about any biomedical topic!

=== "Command Line"

    **Best for**: Direct queries, scripting, automation

    1. **Install BioMCP**:
       ```bash
       # Using uv (recommended)
       uv tool install biomcp

       # Or using pip
       pip install biomcp-python
       ```

    2. **Run your first search**:
       ```bash
       biomcp article search \
         --gene BRAF --disease melanoma \
         --limit 5
       ```

    [CLI Reference ‚Üí](user-guides/01-command-line-interface.md)

=== "Python SDK"

    **Best for**: Integration, custom applications, bulk operations

    1. **Install the package**:
       ```bash
       pip install biomcp-python
       ```

    2. **Use in your code**:
       ```python
       from biomcp import BioMCPClient

       async with BioMCPClient() as client:
           articles = await client.articles.search(
               genes=["BRAF"],
               diseases=["melanoma"]
           )
       ```
