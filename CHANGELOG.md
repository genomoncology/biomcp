  - Dual source support for trial search/getter tools (ClinicalTrials.gov + NCI)
  - NCI API key handling via `NCI_API_KEY` environment variable or parameter
  - Advanced trial filters: biomarkers, prior therapy, brain metastases acceptance
  - **6 New MCP Tools** for NCI-specific searches:
    - `nci_organization_searcher` / `nci_organization_getter`: Cancer centers, hospitals, research institutions
    - `nci_intervention_searcher` / `nci_intervention_getter`: Drugs, devices, procedures, biologicals
    - `nci_biomarker_searcher`: Trial eligibility biomarkers (reference genes, branches)
    - `nci_disease_searcher`: NCI's controlled vocabulary of cancer conditions

  - Automatic cBioPortal integration for gene searches
  - Proper NCI parameter mapping (org_city, org_state_or_province, etc.)
  - Comprehensive error handling for Elasticsearch limits

### Changed

- Enhanced unified search router to properly handle NCI domains
- Trial search/getter tools now accept `source` parameter ("clinicaltrials" or "nci")
- Improved domain-specific search logic for query+domain combinations

### Added CLI Commands

```bash
# Organization search/get
biomcp organization search "MD Anderson" --api-key YOUR_KEY
biomcp organization get 12345 --api-key YOUR_KEY

## [0.6.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added

- **Streamable HTTP Transport Support** (#45) - MCP specification version 2025-03-26:
  - Enabled FastMCP's native `/mcp` endpoint for Streamable HTTP transport
  - MCP specification compliant transport (2025-03-26 spec) via FastMCP 1.12.3+
  - CLI support via `biomcp run --mode streamable_http` (uses native FastMCP implementation)
  - Full backward compatibility with legacy SSE endpoints
  - Cloudflare Worker updated with POST /mcp route for full spec compliance
  - Simplified worker implementation to leverage FastMCP's built-in transport support
  - Added comprehensive integration tests for streamable HTTP functionality
  - New transport protocol documentation guide

### Changed

- Enhanced CLI with transport modes (stdio, worker, streamable_http)
- Added configurable host and port options for HTTP-based transports
- Simplified server modes by removing redundant `http` mode
- Cloudflare Worker now supports both GET and POST methods on /mcp endpoint
- Pinned FastMCP dependency to version range >=1.12.3,<2.0.0 for stability
- Standardized documentation file naming to lowercase with hyphens for consistency

### Migration Notes

- **From SSE to Streamable HTTP**: Update your server startup from `--mode worker` to `--mode streamable_http`
- **Docker deployments**: Ensure you're using `--host 0.0.0.0` for proper container networking
- **Cloudflare Workers**: The worker now automatically handles both transport types on `/mcp`
- See the new [Transport Protocol Guide](https://biomcp.org/transport-protocol/) for detailed migration instructions

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added

- **BioThings Integration** for real-time biomedical data access:
  - **New MCP Tools** (3 tools added, total now 17):
    - `gene_getter`: Query MyGene.info for gene information (symbols, names, summaries)
    - `drug_getter`: Query MyChem.info for drug/chemical data (formulas, indications, mechanisms)
    - `disease_getter`: Query MyDisease.info for disease information (definitions, synonyms, ontologies)
  - **Unified Search/Fetch Enhancement**:
    - Added `gene`, `drug`, `disease` as new searchable domains alongside article, trial, variant
    - Integrated into unified search syntax: `search(domain="gene", keywords=["BRAF"])`
    - Query language support: `gene:BRAF`, `drug:pembrolizumab`, `disease:melanoma`
    - Full fetch support: `fetch(domain="drug", id="DB00945")`
  - **Clinical Trial Enhancement**:
    - Automatic disease synonym expansion for trial searches
    - Real-time synonym lookup from MyDisease.info
    - Example: searching for "GIST" automatically includes "gastrointestinal stromal tumor"
  - **Smart Caching & Performance**:
    - Batch operations for multiple gene/drug lookups
    - Intelligent caching with TTL (gene: 24h, drug: 48h, disease: 72h)
    - Rate limiting to respect API guidelines

### Changed
