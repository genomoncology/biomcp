# Pattern: Clinical Trial Matching

Find eligible trials for a patient with specific characteristics.

## Workflow

1. **Search by condition** - Primary disease/indication
2. **Filter by status** - OPEN, RECRUITING, etc.
3. **Add molecular criteria** - Specific mutations or biomarkers
4. **Refine by phase/location** - Phase 3, geographic proximity

## Tips

- Status values are UPPERCASE
- Cross-reference with variant data for eligibility
