# Use Case: Hereditary Cancer Syndromes

Research hereditary cancer syndromes including variant interpretation and surveillance trials.

## Workflow

1. **Search clinical trials** - Trials for syndrome patients
2. **Search causative gene variants** - Pathogenic variants in syndrome genes
3. **Check all genes in panel** - Multiple genes per syndrome
4. **Get disease information** - Syndrome details and synonyms
5. **Search literature** - Syndrome-specific research

## Hereditary Cancer Syndromes

| Syndrome    | Genes                  | Key Cancers             |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Lynch       | MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 | Colorectal, endometrial |
| HBOC        | BRCA1, BRCA2           | Breast, ovarian         |
| FAP         | APC                    | Colorectal              |
| Li-Fraumeni | TP53                   | Multiple                |
| Cowden      | PTEN                   | Breast, thyroid         |

## Lynch Syndrome Genes

| Gene  | Associated Cancers                     |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| MLH1  | Colorectal, endometrial, ovarian       |
| MSH2  | Colorectal, endometrial, urinary tract |
| MSH6  | Colorectal, endometrial                |
| PMS2  | Colorectal (lower penetrance)          |
| EPCAM | Colorectal (MSH2 silencing)            |

## Trial Types for Hereditary Syndromes

| Type         | Purpose                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Surveillance | Optimizing screening protocols  |
| Prevention   | Chemoprevention, risk reduction |
| Diagnostic   | Biomarker development           |
| Treatment    | Cancer-specific therapies       |

## Tips

- Search all genes in a syndrome panel
- Include both syndrome name and gene names in searches
- Check for prevention/risk reduction trials
- Consider family testing implications
