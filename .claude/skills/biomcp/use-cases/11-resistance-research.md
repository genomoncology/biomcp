# Pattern: Resistance & Next-Line Options

Research resistance mechanisms and find trials for patients who progressed on prior therapy.

## Workflow

1. **Search literature** - Resistance mechanisms, acquired mutations
2. **Find post-progression trials** - Trials accepting prior treatment failures
3. **Check alternative agents** - Approved drugs for refractory disease

## Tips

- Use `--keyword resistance` or `--keyword refractory` in article search
- Use `--progression-on` flag in trial search for post-treatment trials
- Use `--line-of-therapy 2L` or `3L+` to filter by treatment line
- Combine gene + drug name + "resistance" for targeted literature
