# Use Case: Cell Therapy Trial Landscape

Explore clinical trials for CAR-T and other cell therapies.

## Workflow

1. **Search cell therapy trials** - Find CAR-T, TIL, TCR-T trials
2. **Filter by indication** - Specific cancer types
3. **Filter by intervention type** - Biological/cell-based
4. **Get trial details** - Eligibility and design
5. **Search literature** - Recent publications

## Cell Therapy Types

| Therapy | Search Term                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| CAR-T   | `--term "CAR-T"`                          |
| TIL     | `--term "tumor infiltrating lymphocytes"` |
| TCR-T   | `--term "TCR T cell"`                     |
| NK cell | `--term "NK cell therapy"`                |

## Key Indications

- B-cell lymphomas (CD19 CAR-T)
- Multiple myeloma (BCMA CAR-T)
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
- Solid tumors (emerging)

## Tips

- CAR-T trials often have complex eligibility criteria
- Check for prior therapy requirements
- Note manufacturing timeline (2-4 weeks for autologous)
- Review CRS/ICANS monitoring requirements
