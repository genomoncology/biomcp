# Pattern: Drug Investigation

Investigate a drug's safety profile, approvals, and current status.

## Workflow

1. **Search adverse events** - Serious AEs, specific reactions
2. **Check approval history** - When approved, for what indications
3. **Review drug labels** - Warnings, contraindications, interactions
4. **Check shortage status** - Supply chain issues

## Tips

- Use `--serious` flag to focus on serious adverse events
- Combine with literature search for case reports
