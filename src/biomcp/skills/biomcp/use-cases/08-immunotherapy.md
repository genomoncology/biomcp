# Use Case: Immunotherapy Biomarker Trials

Find immunotherapy trials based on biomarker status.

## Workflow

1. **Search by biomarker** - PD-L1, TMB, MSI-H
2. **Filter for biologics** - Immunotherapy agents
3. **Search checkpoint inhibitor trials** - Specific drugs
4. **Search combination trials** - Multi-agent regimens
5. **Check drug safety** - Adverse event profiles

## Key Immunotherapy Biomarkers

| Biomarker | Relevance                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| PD-L1     | Checkpoint inhibitor response  |
| TMB       | Tumor mutational burden        |
| MSI-H     | Microsatellite instability     |
| TILs      | Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes |

## Immunotherapy Drug Classes

| Class             | Examples                 | Target |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------ |
| PD-1 inhibitors   | Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab | PD-1   |
| PD-L1 inhibitors  | Atezolizumab, Durvalumab | PD-L1  |
| CTLA-4 inhibitors | Ipilimumab               | CTLA-4 |
| LAG-3 inhibitors  | Relatlimab               | LAG-3  |

## Immune-Related Adverse Events

Monitor for: Pneumonitis, Colitis, Hepatitis, Thyroid dysfunction, Skin reactions

## Tips

- Biomarker cutoffs vary by trial (e.g., PD-L1 ≥1% vs ≥50%)
- Check eligibility for prior immunotherapy exposure
- Consider combination vs monotherapy trials
