# Pattern: Mutation to Treatment Options

When a patient has a detected mutation, find actionable information.

## Workflow

1. **Get variant annotations** - Clinical significance, population frequency
2. **Find matching trials** - Trials requiring or studying this mutation
3. **Search literature** - Treatment evidence, resistance mechanisms
4. **Check approved therapies** - FDA-approved drugs for the indication

## Tips

- Combine gene + disease + mutation terms for specific results
- Cross-reference variant pathogenicity with trial eligibility
