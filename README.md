# BioMCP: Biomedical Model Context Protocol

BioMCP is an open source (MIT License) toolkit that empowers AI assistants and
agents with specialized biomedical knowledge. Built following the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), it connects AI systems to authoritative biomedical data
sources, enabling them to answer questions about clinical trials, scientific
literature, and genomic variants with precision and depth.

## Why BioMCP?

While Large Language Models have broad general knowledge, they often lack
specialized domain-specific information or access to up-to-date resources.
BioMCP bridges this gap for biomedicine by:

- Providing **structured access** to clinical trials, biomedical literature,
  and genomic variants
- Enabling **natural language queries** to specialized databases without
  requiring knowledge of their specific syntax
- Supporting **biomedical research** workflows through a consistent interface
- Functioning as an **MCP server** for AI assistants and agents

## Biomedical Data Sources

BioMCP integrates with multiple biomedical data sources:

### Literature Sources

- **PubTator3/PubMed** - Peer-reviewed biomedical literature with entity annotations
- **bioRxiv/medRxiv** - Preprint servers for biology and health sciences
- **Europe PMC** - Open science platform including preprints

### Clinical & Genomic Sources

- **ClinicalTrials.gov** - Clinical trial registry and results database
- **MyVariant.info** - Consolidated genetic variant annotation
- **TCGA/GDC** - The Cancer Genome Atlas for cancer variant data
- **1000 Genomes** - Population frequency data via Ensembl

## Available MCP Tools

### Literature Search

- `article_searcher`: Search both peer-reviewed and preprint articles by genes, diseases, variants, or keywords (includes PubMed, bioRxiv/medRxiv, and Europe PMC by default)
- `article_details`: Get detailed article information including abstracts and full text

### ClinicalTrials.gov

- `trial_searcher`: Advanced trial search with filtering by condition,
  intervention, phase, etc.
- `trial_protocol`: Detailed trial protocol information
- `trial_locations`: Trial site locations and contact information
- `trial_outcomes`: Results and outcome measures
- `trial_references`: Related publications

### Genetic Variants

- `variant_searcher`: Search for genetic variants with sophisticated filtering
- `variant_details`: Comprehensive annotations from multiple sources including:
  - Core databases: CIViC, ClinVar, COSMIC, dbSNP
  - Cancer data: TCGA/GDC tumor frequencies
  - Population data: 1000 Genomes allele frequencies

### Sequential Thinking

- `sequential_thinking`: A problem-solving tool for dynamic and reflective thinking,
  helping analyze complex biomedical problems through a flexible, adaptive process

## Quick Start

### For Claude Desktop Users

1. **Install `uv`** if you don't have it (recommended):

   ```bash
   # MacOS
   brew install uv

   # Windows/Linux
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   - Open Claude Desktop settings
   - Navigate to Developer section
   - Click "Edit Config" and add:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "biomcp": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["run", "--with", "biomcp-python", "biomcp", "run"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Restart Claude Desktop and start chatting about biomedical topics!

### Python Package Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install biomcp-python

# Using uv (recommended for faster installation)
uv pip install biomcp-python

# Run directly without installation
uv run --with biomcp-python biomcp trial search --condition "lung cancer"
```

## Command Line Interface

BioMCP provides a comprehensive CLI for direct database interaction:

```bash
# Get help
biomcp --help

# Run the MCP server
biomcp run

# Article search examples
biomcp article search --gene BRAF --disease Melanoma  # Includes preprints by default
biomcp article search --gene BRAF --no-preprints      # Exclude preprints
biomcp article get 21717063 --full

# Clinical trial examples
biomcp trial search --condition "Lung Cancer" --phase PHASE3
biomcp trial get NCT04280705 Protocol

# Variant examples with external annotations
biomcp variant search --gene TP53 --significance pathogenic
biomcp variant get rs113488022  # Includes TCGA and 1000 Genomes data by default
biomcp variant get rs113488022 --no-external  # Core annotations only
```

## Testing & Verification

Test your BioMCP setup with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run --with biomcp-python biomcp run
```

This opens a web interface where you can explore and test all available tools.
